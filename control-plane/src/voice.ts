/**
 * Voice rooms — one per game server, created by whoever arrives first.
 *
 * A room is a Durable Object addressed by the server key the app already computes for paint
 * sync (`server_key_for`). That is the whole of "is there a room for this server?": naming a
 * Durable Object *is* creating it if it doesn't exist, and it evicts itself once the last
 * rider disconnects. No table of rooms, no reaper, no lifecycle to get wrong.
 *
 * The room never carries audio. It carries the few kilobytes of ICE negotiation two apps
 * need to find each other, and then gets out of the way — the voice itself goes peer to
 * peer, which is what makes this free to run on servers we don't own and can't bill for.
 *
 * ## What the room does and does not vouch for
 *
 * The Worker admits a socket only if the bearer token resolves to an account *and* that
 * account's presence row says it is on this server. Presence is self-reported, so this
 * proves an account, not a rider: on a community server nothing can prove someone is really
 * on that grid.
 *
 * The claim that matters is therefore checked by the receiving app, not here — it plays a
 * peer only if that peer's race number appears in its own copy of the game's race-entry
 * list. So `riderName` and `raceNum` below are the peer's own claims, relayed verbatim and
 * believed by nobody. Anything that must be trusted is derived from the token instead.
