 * Slim bar for the two things that stop FrostMod reaching the game and can't be fixed
 * behind the player's back.
 *
 * **A stray `msvcr90.dll`** beside the game exe, which aborts MX Bikes with R6034 the
 * moment anything plain-imports the CRT. The app deletes the copies it planted itself, but
 * a file it can't prove it planted is somebody else's, and moving it aside has to be a
 * press. This one is red and outranks the other: it is an active crash, not a gap.
 *
 * **A missing Visual C++ runtime**, which needs admin rights to install, so it likewise has
 * to be a button. It earns a bar rather than living only in Settings because the symptom —
 * FrostMod silently failing to attach, or a bare "…dll was not found" box over the game —
 * gives no hint that Settings is where to look.
 *
 * Renders nothing when neither applies, which is the overwhelmingly common case.
