 * doing this in an image editor is guesswork — you move a logo, save, pack, launch, look, and
 * move it again. Everything here exists to close that loop: the sheet you're drawing *is* the
 * texture on the model beside it, and Save writes the packed file the game reads rather than
 * an export somebody else's tool has to convert.
 *
 * There's a brush too, and a gradient, and shapes — see `paint.ts`. They paint into a layer of
 * their own rather than into the sheet, so the template underneath survives every stroke and
 * the whole tool kit inherits opacity, blending and stacking from the layer system for free.
 *
 * What it deliberately still isn't: a general image editor. No selections, no filters, no
 * masks. It draws liveries, and it knows where they go.
