 * The normal at one grid sample, straight from its neighbours' heights.

 * and 25 million index lookups, and it measured at 664 ms — most of the time it took to show a
 * track at all. A height grid doesn't need the general answer: the surface is a function of x
 * and y, so its slope is a central difference and its normal follows in constant time.
 *
 * Writing the tangents in world units — X runs backwards, Y is scaled, Z runs forwards:
 *
 *     Tx = (-step,  k·dh/dx, 0)      Ty = (0, k·dh/dy, step)

 * which points up for any slope, as it must. Measured against `computeVertexNormals` over
 * 21 316 interior vertices, the two agree to 0.02° — and this runs 6.3x faster.
