 * because it is a third store with its own session, not a variant of either. What it *does*
 * share is the shape of its answers: a Hub listing is a `ShopMod` with a slug, and a Hub
 * purchase is a `ShopItem`, so the grid, the price tag, the purchase card and the detail page
 * are the shop's components used as they are.
 *
 * Two halves, gated differently. Browsing needs nothing — the store's WooCommerce API is
 * public, so unlike the shop's catalog there is no build-time credential and no reason to ever
 * hide this half. Installing needs the user's own sign-in, and nothing else.
