//! Abort flags for in-flight installs, keyed by mod slug.
//!
//! Keyed by slug because that is already how an install identifies itself on the wire — the
//! `install-progress` event carries nothing else ([`crate::install`]).
//!
//! Several installs now run at once, so "a slug is never ambiguous" is no longer free: it is
//! upheld by the queue, which will not start a job whose slug is already running (`pump` in
//! `Context/Install.tsx`). Two overlapping jobs under one slug would share this flag *and*
//! their progress events — cancelling one would stop the other, and their bars would report
//! into each other. Anything that lets a slug run twice at once has to give the backend a
//! per-job id first.
//!
//! The flag is looked up by slug at each check point rather than threaded through as a parameter.
//! That keeps [`crate::install::download`] signature-compatible with [`crate::shop_fetch::download`],
//! which is load-bearing: `shop_stage` swaps one for the other.
