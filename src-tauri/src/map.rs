//! Reading a track's scenery mesh out of its `.map`.
//!
//! The `.map` is not the riding surface — that comes from the `.trh`. It holds everything
//! standing on and around it: tents, hay bales, banner lines, fences, poles, vehicles, and
//! the landscape beyond the terrain square. The two are disjoint and share one world frame
//! in metres, so they compose without any fitting.
//!
//! ```text
//!  0x00  "MP2\0"
//!  0x04  u32 = 304 (constant on every map measured)
//!  0x08  u32 material_count
//!  0x0C  material_count x 56-byte material records
//!        u32 vc
//!        vc x 80 B, structure-of-arrays: pos @ +0 | uv0 @ +12*vc | normal @ +52*vc
//!        u32 tc
//!        tc x 3 u32 indices
//!        u32 node_count, then a tree of 44 B nodes
//!        ... the rest of the file is embedded textures — most of its bulk
//! ```
//!
//! The tree carries the draw calls. Each node is an AABB and five words; the fifth is a
//! group count, and zero means an inner node. A leaf's groups follow it inline, 24 bytes
//! each, and say which material paints which run of triangles. Sorted by material they
//! become the handful of draw calls the viewer needs.
//!
//! Textures sit after the tree in the same records an `.edf` uses — a name, its dimensions,
//! then raw-DEFLATE RGBA — with one difference that matters: a map's can be 16 or 32 pixels
//! across, which [`crate::edf::embedded_textures`] rejects, so this reads them itself.
//! Their names carry the only statement of what a surface *is*: `_c` is colour, and
//! **`_c_a` is colour with an alpha cut-out** — foliage, crowd, fencing. Drawn opaque those
//! read as solid slabs, so the suffix is what keeps a forest looking like a forest.
//!
//! Same shape as an `.edf` node, at 80 bytes per vertex rather than 72, so the normal sits
//! at byte 52 instead of 44. Reading it one byte out is not subtle: normal lengths are all
//! exactly 1.0 at the right offset and noise at any other, which is the check
//! [`parse`] makes before believing a file.
