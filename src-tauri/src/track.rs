//! Reading a track well enough to show it.
//!
//! A track is the largest thing the app handles — a few hundred megabytes of textures and
//! scenery around a terrain grid that is the only part worth drawing. Everything here is
//! arranged so that showing one costs the grid and nothing else:
//!
//! * The inventory ([`read_info`]) never inflates a byte. Naming a track's parts is a
//!   question the archive's index already answers, and answering it that way is the
//!   difference between a view that opens at once and one that waits on a 400 MB unpack.
//! * The terrain is inflated once, probed once, and reduced immediately to a master grid
//!   small enough to keep ([`MASTER_DIM`]). Every level of detail the viewer asks for after
//!   that is resampled from the master, in memory.
//! * The master is written to disk, so opening the same track tomorrow skips the inflate and
//!   the probe both. This is the cache that matters: the probe is milliseconds, while pulling
//!   a heightfield out of a large archive is most of a second.
