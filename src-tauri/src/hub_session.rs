//! The signed-in MXB Hub session — cookies for `shop.mxb-hub.com`, and the client that uses
//! them.
//!
//! The shape is [`crate::shop_session`]'s, with one large simplification: **MXB Hub is not
//! behind Cloudflare** (measured: `server: nginx`, no `cf-ray`, no interstitial on
//! `/my-account/`). That is what lets this keep a real `reqwest` client built from the
//! captured cookies, which mxbikes-shop.com had to give up — there, every signed-in path is a
//! managed challenge an HTTP client cannot clear, so its pages are read out of a parked
//! WebView instead ([`crate::shop_fetch`]). None of that machinery is needed here: a WebView
//! is opened once, for the user to type their password into, and everything after that is
//! ordinary HTTP.
