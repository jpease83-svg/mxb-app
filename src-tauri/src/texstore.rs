//! Decoded texture pixels, held here instead of being shipped as text.
//!
//! Every texture the viewer shows used to travel to the webview as a
//! `data:image/png;base64,…` string: a PNG encode per texture (seconds of every core on a
//! bike with a handful of 1024² liveries), a 37% base64 tax on top, and a multi-megabyte
//! string that then lived in the Rust cache, the JSON payload and the JS heap at once.
//!
//! Instead the raw RGBA stays in this store and the frontend gets a short token. It fetches
//! the pixels over binary IPC (`texture_bytes`) and hands them straight to a
//! `THREE.DataTexture`, so nothing is ever encoded or stringified.
//!
//! Ownership: `to_texture` is called once per texture per source load, so a token belongs
//! to exactly one `bike_cache` entry — no refcounting. That entry calls [`release`] when it
//! leaves the cache, which means evicted *or* replaced in place: a bike built twice under
//! one key displaces the first build, and its pixels are freed by nothing else. Paths with no cache of their own (a gear `.pnt` re-decoded on every pick)
//! rely on [`CAP_BYTES`] reaping the oldest blobs.
