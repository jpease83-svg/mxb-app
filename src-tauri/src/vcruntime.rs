//! Visual C++ runtime preflight for the FrostMod chain.
//!
//! Two different runtimes have to be present before FrostMod can attach to the game,
//! and when either is missing Windows says so with a bare "the code execution cannot
//! proceed because <something>.dll was not found" box over the game — a message with no
//! path from the error to the fix.
//!
//! **VC90 (Visual C++ 2008).** `mxbikes.exe` and `gpbikes.exe` are x64 PiBoSo builds that
//! import `MSVCR90.dll`. They don't import it by path: their manifest requests it as a
//! side-by-side assembly (`Microsoft.VC90.CRT`, amd64, publicKeyToken `1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b`,
//! versions `9.0.21022.8` and `9.0.30729.1`). That resolves machine-wide out of `WinSxS`,
//! or out of a private assembly folder sitting beside the exe.
//!
//! The redistributable does not put `msvcr90.dll` anywhere on the ordinary DLL search
//! path. It registers the side-by-side assembly under `WinSxS`, and reaching that requires
//! the loading module to *ask for it by manifest*. The game does. A module that doesn't —
//! anything with a plain `MSVCR90.dll` import and no VC90 manifest, which is most
//! community plugins built with VS2008 — gets the ordinary search order instead: the exe's
//! own folder, `System32`, `PATH`. The redistributable touches none of those.
//!
//! So the two failures read differently, and the wording in the dialog tells them apart:
//!
//! * *"the side-by-side configuration is incorrect"* (error 14001) — the **game's**
//!   manifested dependency is unsatisfiable. Installing the redistributable fixes it.
//! * *"MSVCR90.dll was not found"* / *"is missing from your computer"* — a **plain
//!   import** went unresolved.
//!
//! **The second one has no app-local cure, and an earlier version of this module shipped
//! one anyway.** It copied `msvcr90.dll` out of `WinSxS` and laid it beside the exe, on the
//! reasoning that a loose DLL is invisible to side-by-side binding and so can only ever
//! serve the plain imports the redistributable strands. The first half is true. The second
//! does not follow, because the VC9 CRT polices this itself: `msvcr90.dll` checks at load
//! time that it was resolved through a `Microsoft.VC90.CRT` activation context, and a loose
//! copy in the exe's own directory is by definition outside one. It refuses to initialise
//! and takes the process down with
//!
//! ```text
//! R6034 — An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrectly.
//! ```
//!
//! Which makes the copy never once helpful and frequently fatal. A module carrying a VC90
//! manifest resolves from `WinSxS` and never looks at it; a module without one finds it and
//! dies. We turned a plugin that quietly failed to load into a modal that killed the game —
//! see [`remove_stray_msvcr90`], which now takes back the copies we made.
//!
//! What does work app-locally is a *private assembly*: a `Microsoft.VC90.CRT` folder beside
//! the exe holding the DLL and its manifest, which is a real side-by-side identity and
//! satisfies the check. PiBoSo installers have historically laid one down, so [`vc90_present`]
//! counts it. We don't build one — it participates in binding, and a version-mismatched one
//! could hijack a binding that currently works. The redistributable is the cure we offer.
//!
//! **VC140 (Visual C++ 2015–2022).** `frostmod.dll` and `frostmod.exe` are modern MSVC
//! builds. Their import tables name `VCRUNTIME140.dll`, `VCRUNTIME140_1.dll`,
//! `MSVCP140.dll` and the UCRT — and, notably, never `MSVCR90.dll`. Injection failing is
//! therefore always a VC140 story, never a VC90 one. `VCRUNTIME140_1.dll` is the easy one
//! to miss: it only ships from the 2019 redistributable onward, so a machine still on the
//! original 2015 package has the other two and not it.
//!
//! **The app's own image needs VC140 as well, and nothing in this module can say so.**
//! `MXB App.exe` imports `std::_Xout_of_range` and `std::_Xlength_error` from
//! `MSVCP140.dll` — the STL's throw helpers, by way of the C++ sources `unrar_sys` builds
//! against the dynamic CRT. Without the redistributable the loader gives up before `main`
//! with *"the application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b)"*, and none of the
//! code below ever runs. That check has to live outside the process, and does:
//! `installer-hooks.nsh` probes for the same three files before the app is written. See
//! `tests::the_installer_probes_the_same_runtime_we_do` for what keeps the two copies
//! from drifting.
//!
//! We detect both, and can install either. Detection is deliberately conservative: when
//! we can't tell, we report nothing missing. Telling a working player their PC is broken
//! is worse than staying quiet.

// Detection and installation are Windows-only by construction; everywhere else this module
// compiles down to `missing() -> []` and the rest of it reads as dead. Left visible, that's
// a handful of warnings on every macOS build, which only teaches us to skim past them.
