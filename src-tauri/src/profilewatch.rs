//! Notice when the *game* changes what the rider is wearing.
//!
//! Paint sync publishes whenever the app writes a look. That covers the Locker and the
//! Manage tab, and misses the way most riders actually change kit: in the game's own garage.
//! MX Bikes writes the same `profile.ini` the app does, so the file itself is the signal —
//! there just wasn't anything listening to it.
//!
//! It has a second reader now: the look watcher in `main` follows the paints the rider is
//! wearing, and `profile.ini` is the file that says which those are. A change here re-points
//! it — see `crate::look_changed`.
//!
//! `modwatch` deliberately stays out of `profiles/`, and its reasoning still holds: that
//! folder churns all through a session with replays, telemetry and settings, and a watcher
//! reacting to all of it would fire constantly mid-race. This one is not that watcher. It
//! filters to exactly `profile.ini` — never the `profile.ini.bak` that `presets::apply_loadout`
//! writes alongside it — which is a file that changes only when a look does.
//!
//! It also makes no attempt to tell the game's writes from the app's. It doesn't need to:
//! `paintsync::publish_all` hashes the look and sends nothing when the digest is unchanged,
//! so a redundant fire costs one local hash and no request. That is the whole reason this
//! can be a dumb watcher rather than a careful one.
