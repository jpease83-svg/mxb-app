//! Which installed mods the game is allowed to see.
//!
//! MX Bikes mounts every `.pkz` under `<MX Bikes>/mods` at startup, so a big library is
//! paid for on every load — even though a race needs one track, one bike, one gear set and
//! a couple of support packs. Disabling a mod here means *moving it out of the way*: into
//! `<MX Bikes>/mxbapp_disabled`, mirroring its path under `mods` so putting it back is
//! exact.
//!
//! Rider gear paints ride along for a different reason. A loose `.pnt` costs nothing to
//! mount, but it is a row in the game's own gear pickers — and a preset that names one
//! helmet paint means the other four hundred should be out of sight, not merely cheap.
//!
//! The mirrored path is the whole record. There's no manifest to fall out of step with the
//! disk when app data is wiped, a folder is moved by hand, or two copies of the app run at
//! once — restoring is just "walk the shadow tree and move everything back".
//!
//! Same volume, so each move is a rename: taking 400 mods out of the way costs milliseconds.
