//! Where the logs are, and how to get them off the machine they're on.
//!
//! Three sets matter when something has gone wrong, and they live in different places:
//! MXB App's own file log — written by `tauri_plugin_log` into the OS log dir
//! (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.frost.mxbikes\logs` on Windows) — the game's `log.txt`, which
//! PiBoSo titles write beside the executable or into the user folder depending on how the
//! game was started, and whatever FrostMod leaves in the folder we install and run it
//! from. Which of the three matters depends entirely on what broke, and the player
//! reporting it is the last person who can tell.
//!
//! None of them is somewhere a player finds on their own, and "send me your logs" is the
//! first thing every bug report asks for. So this module answers four questions for
//! Settings: where they are, what's actually in there, how to hand the lot over as one
//! file, and — since the file still has to get to whoever asked — how to turn that file
//! into a link, through the same upload a shared track goes out on.
