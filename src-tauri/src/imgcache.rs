//! A disk cache for remote thumbnails, served to the webview over a custom URI scheme.
//!
//! Both catalogs put remote URLs straight into `<img src>`, so every scroll through a grid
//! re-fetched the same images across the internet. This puts a cache in front of that, for
//! mxb-mods.com and mxbikes-shop.com alike.
//!
//! Why a URI scheme rather than a command returning base64: the shop catalog is ~1300 items.
//! Data URIs would hold tens of megabytes of inflated strings in React state, cost an IPC
//! round-trip per image, bypass the webview's own image cache, and defeat `loading="lazy"`
//! outright — you have to fetch an image to build its `src`, so nothing can be deferred. A
//! scheme URL is a short string the webview resolves only when the image scrolls into view.
//!
//! The frontend never constructs these URLs by hand; see `cachedImage()` in
//! `src/lib/imgcache.ts`, which uses Tauri's `convertFileSrc` because the scheme resolves to
//! a different shape on Windows than on macOS and Linux.
