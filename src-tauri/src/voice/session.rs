//! Turning up on a server is the only thing a rider has to do to be in voice.
//!
//! This is the supervisor: a standing loop that watches which server the game is on and
//! keeps exactly one engine running for it. Joining, leaving and re-joining are consequences
//! of racing, not buttons — nobody picks a room, types an address, shares a code, or waits
//! for anyone to host anything.
//!
//! It also does the one bit of paperwork the player would otherwise have to: an app with no
//! control-plane account claims one, silently, the first time voice is switched on.
//!
//! ## Knowing which server
//!
//! FrostMod tells us. `EventInit` hands the plugin `m_szServerName`, and that name is the
//! room key — the only identifier every rider on a server has. An address reaches only the
//! riders whose app launched the game; anyone who picked the server from the game's own
//! browser never sees one, and a key half the grid cannot compute is a room that splits in
//! two without anybody noticing.
//!
//! So voice needs FrostMod running, which the app already installs and arms for every
//! session. Without it there is no server name, and without a server name there is nothing
//! to join — reported as such rather than guessed at.
