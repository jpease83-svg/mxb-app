//! The control-plane end of voice: get an account, get into the room, relay ICE.
//!
//! Everything here exists to keep the player from having to do anything. They do not sign up,
//! they are not given a code, and they never see this. The app claims an account for itself
//! the first time voice is switched on, and from then on it is a token in the config file
//! like any other setting.
//!
//! The room itself is a WebSocket to a Durable Object named after the server. Joining one
//! that nobody has used before and joining one with ten riders already in it are the same
//! request — there is nothing to create and nothing to look up first.
//!
//! Blocking, on its own thread, talking to the engine over channels. Signalling is a few
//! kilobytes at join and near-silence afterwards, so an async runtime would be all cost.
