//! Voice chat: talk to the riders around you, on any server, with nothing to set up.
//!
//! That last part is the whole design constraint. The player installs the app — which many
//! already have — picks a microphone, and is talking. No second program to download, no
//! account to create by hand, no port to forward, and **nothing whatsoever for the server
//! operator to install**. A server has voice because riders with the app turned up on it.
//!
//! ## How the pieces fit
//!
//! ```text
//!   game ──► frostmod ──► who is on the grid, and where          (proximity, phase 4)
//!                              │
//!   control plane ◄── join(serverKey) ── engine ──► peers ══ Opus over DTLS ══► other apps
//!    a room per server,                    │
//!    signalling only                       └─► capture · encode · jitter · mix · playback
//! ```
//!
//! - [`devices`] — the microphone, the speakers, the meter, the push-to-talk key. Everything
//!   the player actually configures, and the only part of voice with a settings page.
//! - [`frame`] — what one 20 ms packet looks like on the wire.
//! - [`codec`] — Opus in and out, at the one format we ever use.
//! - [`jitter`] — per-sender reordering and loss concealment, because the network is not a
//!   pipe and a dropped frame must not become a click.
//! - [`signal`] — the control-plane end: claim an account if this app doesn't have one, join
//!   the room for the server we're on, and relay ICE.
//! - [`gamesession`] — which server the game is on and where every rider is, read out of
//!   FrostMod's shared block. The app cannot see any of it for itself.
//! - [`stun`] — what this socket looks like from outside, without which two riders behind
//!   home routers can describe themselves to each other and still never connect.
//! - [`ring`] — the lock-free handoff to the audio callback, which may not wait for anything.
//! - [`mesh`] — the peers themselves: one UDP socket, one `Rtc` per peer, demultiplexed by
//!   remote address.
//! - [`engine`] — the loop that owns all of the above and runs on its own thread.
//! - [`session`] — the supervisor that joins and leaves as the rider moves between servers,
//!   so none of this is ever something they have to do.
//!
//! ## Why a thread and not the async runtime
//!
//! The spike measured the transport adding essentially nothing to end-to-end latency, and
//! the poll loop adding all of it: a 5 ms sleep between polls cost 12 ms, a 1 ms sleep cost
//! 2.7 ms. Voice is a hard 20 ms cadence with a realtime audio callback at each end, so it
//! gets a dedicated thread that is never behind something else's work.
