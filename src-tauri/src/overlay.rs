//! The in-game overlay: a frameless, always-on-top window summoned by a global hotkey
//! so presets and swaps can be changed without alt-tabbing out of MX Bikes.
//!
//! It's a second webview onto the same bundle (`index.html?overlay=1`), which is what
//! lets it reuse the Presets / Locker / Browse UI verbatim. The payoff is the live-apply
//! path that already exists: [`crate::gameproc::refresh_look`] pushes a look change into
//! the running game, so a preset picked here shows up without leaving the session.
//!
//! What it deliberately does *not* do is draw inside the game's swapchain. Exclusive
//! fullscreen therefore covers it — see [`fullscreen_hint`].
