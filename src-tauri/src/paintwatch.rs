//! Notice when a paint gets rewritten on disk, and tell whoever is wearing it.
//!
//! A painter's loop is draw, look at it on the model, fix, look again. The "look" step used
//! to mean closing the viewer and opening it again, because the app read the `.pnt` once and
//! never asked after it. This watches the files it is pointed at and says when they change.
//!
//! There are two things that can be dressed in a paint, so there are two watch sets:
//!
//! * [`PaintWatcher`] — the paint the 3D viewer is showing. The frontend re-decodes it and
//!   re-dresses the model.
//! * [`LookWatcher`] — the paints the *game* is wearing. `main` pushes those into the
//!   running game by re-running its own look loader.
//!
//! Both are the same machinery over a different question, which is why [`start_with`] takes
//! what to do rather than doing it.
//!
//! Two decisions worth keeping:
//!
//! * **The folder is watched, not the file.** Saving a paint usually means writing a temp
//!   file and renaming it over the target, which replaces the inode. A watch registered on
//!   the file itself follows the old one and goes silent after the very first save — the
//!   exact save this exists to catch. A non-recursive watch on the parent folder survives
//!   that, and also catches a paint that doesn't exist yet.
//! * **Events are matched by file name alone.** Only the folders holding watched files are
//!   watched, so anything arriving here is already from a folder we asked about, and the
//!   name is enough. Comparing whole paths would mean out-guessing whatever the OS
//!   canonicalises them to (`/private/var` on macOS, 8.3 names on Windows) for nothing.
//!
//! Each set is replace-the-whole-thing rather than add/remove: a viewer shows one paint and
//! a rider wears one look, so nothing can leak a watch by forgetting to take one back.
//! Unlike `modwatch` there is no settling: a paint is a single file, the debounce below
//! outlasts writing one, and the caller re-tries a decode that lands mid-write anyway.
