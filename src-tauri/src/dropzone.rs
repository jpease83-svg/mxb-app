//! Universal drop handling: work out what the user dropped, show it to them, then install.
//!
//! Everything here is read-only until [`commit`] runs. A drop is staged to a temp directory,
//! classified into [`DropItem`]s, and handed to the UI; nothing under `mods/` is touched until
//! the user confirms. The routing decision itself is **not** made here — it comes from
//! [`crate::install::plan_placement`], the same function [`crate::install::place_mod`] uses, so
//! the destination shown in the review sheet is by construction the destination written to disk.
//!
//! What this module adds on top of the placer is the *category*: `place_mod` has always been
//! told whether it is installing a track or a bike. A dropped file has nobody to tell it, so
//! [`classify_typed`] works it out from the content — and where the content genuinely cannot
//! say (which bike does this loose paint belong to?), the item is marked as needing a choice
//! rather than guessed at.
