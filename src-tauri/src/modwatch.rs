//! Watch the mods **content** folder and ask FrostMod to reload when it changes.
//!
//! The in-app installer already signals a reload after it places a mod (see
//! `install::notify_frostmod`). This module covers the other path: a track or bike
//! the user downloads and drops into the folder themselves. A recursive watcher on
//! `<mods_path>/mods` pulses a reload once the folder has settled.
//!
//! We deliberately watch only `<mods_path>/mods` — where tracks/bikes live — and NOT
//! the sibling `profiles/` folder, which churns constantly during gameplay (replays,
//! telemetry, settings) and would otherwise fire reloads mid-race.
//!
//! Two things keep the reload from being a blunt instrument:
//!
//! * **Settling.** Copying a folder of tracks writes files for as long as the copy
//!   takes, and the debouncer keeps handing us batches throughout. Reloading on each
//!   one asks the game to re-scan its content over and over while it's still being
//!   written. Instead we accumulate and wait for the folder to go quiet.
//! * **Naming what changed.** Each changed path is reduced to the mod it belongs to,
//!   and that set is handed to FrostMod through the command channel so a reload can be
//!   scoped to the new mods rather than the whole collection. The plain reload event is
//!   still pulsed afterwards, so a FrostMod that doesn't know the verb behaves exactly
//!   as it does today.
