//! Getting past MXB Hub's robot challenge, by running it in a real browser.
//!
//! `shop.mxb-hub.com` is on SiteGround, whose bot protection fires on **request rate** rather
//! than on anything about the client. That is why it is invisible to a handful of probes and
//! entirely reproducible the moment a grid asks for a page of twenty-four thumbnails: the
//! store starts answering every path — API and images alike — with a `202` carrying a "Robot
//! Challenge Screen", and keeps doing so until something solves it. Solving it means computing
//! a proof of work in a Web Worker and posting it back, so an HTTP client cannot; a browser
//! can, and gets a cookie for its trouble.
//!
//! So: park a hidden window on the store, let it do that, and hand its cookies to the clients.
//!
//! Deliberately much smaller than [`crate::mxb_fetch`] and [`crate::shop_fetch`], which solve
//! the same shape of problem for the two Cloudflare-fronted sites. Those two have to *read
//! pages* out of the browser, so they inject a script, take a result back over IPC, and pay
//! for that with a capability file granting a remote origin the right to talk to us. Nothing
//! here does: the only thing taken from this window is its cookie jar, which Rust reads from
//! the outside. The page is never given a way to call the app, so there is no IPC surface to
//! get wrong.
