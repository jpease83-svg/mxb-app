//! Running a Windows program inside the Proton prefix the game already uses (Linux).
//!
//! MX Bikes has no Linux build. On Linux it is the same `mxbikes.exe`, run by Steam
//! through Proton inside a Wine prefix at `steamapps/compatdata/<appid>`. FrostMod is a
//! Win32 launcher that injects a Win32 DLL into that process, so the only place it can
//! possibly run is *that* prefix — a copy started any other way is a stranger to the game
//! it is meant to attach to.
//!
//! So this module answers three questions, and nothing else:
//!   - which prefix does this game use, and has it ever been made? ([`find`])
//!   - which Proton owns it? (`config_info`, then whatever is installed)
//!   - how does a path we know as `/home/…` read from inside it? ([`windows_path`])
//!
//! The macOS equivalent is [`crate::winehost`], which answers the same questions for
//! CrossOver/Whisky bottles. They stay apart because nothing about the answers is shared:
//! there the player chose the bottle, here Steam made it.
